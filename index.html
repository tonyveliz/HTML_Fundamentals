  <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
  <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript.
    These are the languages of the web.</p>

  <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

  <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
  <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yperText <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
    language that web developers use to
    structure and describe
    the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>

  <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
    etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

  <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
  </ol>

      Docs.</a>
